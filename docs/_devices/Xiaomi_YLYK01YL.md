notes:
  - The state of the remote sensor shows the combination of both, the attributes shows the button being used and the type of press individually.
  - It will return to 'no press' after the time set with the [reset_timer](configuration_params#reset_timer) option.
  - It is advised to change the reset time to 1 second (default = 35 seconds).
  - Additionally, two binary sensors are generated (one for 'short press', one for 'long press'), which is 'True' when pressing 'on', '+' or '-' and 'False' when pressing 'off'.
