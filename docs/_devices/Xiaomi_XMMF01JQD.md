notes:
  - After each rotation, the sensor state shows the direction. It will return to `no press` after the time set with the [reset_timer](configuration_params#reset_timer) option (default = 35 seconds).
  - The sensor has an attribute which shows the `last button press`. You can use the state change event to trigger an automation in Home Assistant.
